  Our records indicate that the First Aid certificate for ${u_employee} will expire on ${u_expiration_date}.  As required under the Canadian Labour Code Part II, FCC is required to have valid First Aid representatives in all locations.  
</p>
<p>
  We have notified the employee that their certificate will expire and have outlined what they need to do to recertify.  If the First Aid recertification is not completed prior to their expiry date, FCC may be in non-compliance with the Canadian Labour Code.
</p>
<p>
  If this employee cannot, or no longer wishes to be the First Aid representative for your location, please complete the General OH&S request form (${mail_script:general_ohs_link}) and let us know who their replacement will be.
</p>

<p>
  Thank you, <br />
